### Stop typing. Start leading

The industrial revolution of code is over. The artisanal era of "I hope this compiles" is finished.

What you have here isn't a GitHub repository. It's not a template. It's a **Factory**.

A factory doesn't guess. A factory doesn't have "good days." A factory produces excellence because the system—*the practice*—is designed to make mediocrity impossible.

You are no longer a coder. You are the **Director**.

## The Resistance (And How We Beat It)

The *Lizard Brain* wants you to open a file and start hacking. It creates safety in busyness. "Look at me," it says, "I'm typing! I'm productive!"

**We don't do that here.**

This workspace is built on a radical premise: **Code is the last thing we do.**

First, we understand.
Then, we govern.
Then, we verify.
*Then*, and only then, do we build.

We call it **Discovery-First Execution**. It’s the difference between a hackathon project and a product that ships.

## The Tribe (14 Souls)

You are hiring a team of 14 specialists. They don't sleep. They don't complain about meetings. But they have **Souls**. They have opinions. And they will stop you if you try to ship junk.

| The Thinkers | The Builders | The Critics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Requirements BA**<br>Extracts the "Why" | **Architecture SE**<br>Draws the map | **QA Engineer**<br>Breaks the toys |
| **User Story BA**<br>Defines the "What" | **Backend Developer**<br>Building the engine | **Program Analyst**<br>Ensures you're legal |
| **UI/UX Designer**<br>Giving it a soul | **Frontend Developer**<br>Painting the canvas | **Scrum Master**<br>The Traffic Cop |

Each agent respects the **Separation of Powers**. The Developer cannot approve their own code. The Architect cannot skip the requirements. The Scrum Master holds the baton.

## The Practice (Governance)

Most people think governance is bureaucracy.
**Governance is empathy.**

It is empathy for the future user who needs this to work. It is empathy for the future developer who has to read this code.

We enforce this with the **Double-Lock Protocol**:

1. **Lock 1 (The Definition of Ready)**: The Scrum Master will not let work begin until the requirements exist. No more guessing.
2. **Lock 2 (The Phase Gate)**: The Program Analyst will not let you move to the next phase until the documentation proves you are safe.

It feels slow. Until you realize you never have to do it twice.

## Session Zero: Your First Day

You don't configure this workspace. You wake it up.

1. Open this folder in your IDE of choice (Antigravity, Claude, or Codex).
2. Type one sentence:
    > "Initialize the project."
3. **The Interview Begins.**

The Scrum Master will ask you what matters. The Architect will ask about your constraints. The team will align around your vision.

And then? **They go to work.**

---

## The Tech (Tools of the Trade)

This factory speaks three languages fluently. Pick your engine:

* **Google Antigravity**: Read `GEMINI.md`.
* **Anthropic Claude**: Read `CLAUDE.md`.
* **OpenAI Codex**: Read `CODEX.md`.

The files are different keys to the same engine. The outcome is the same: **A shipped product.**

## Go Make a Ruckus

The world doesn't need another half-finished side project.
The world needs your art. It needs the thing only you can see.

This Factory is here to help you ship it.

**Status**: Ready.
**Waiting on**: You.
