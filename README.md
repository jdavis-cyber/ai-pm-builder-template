[![Team: 14 Agents](https://img.shields.io/badge/Team-14%20Agents-green)](.agent/AGENT-ROSTER.md)

**A fully autonomous, self-governing AI software team in a single repository.**

---

## What is this?

This is **not a template**. This is your **Active Workspace**.

It contains a complete 14-agent software development team, pre-configured with:

* **Role-Based Identities** (Souls)
* **Strict Governance** (Directives)
* **Automated Workflow** (Orchestration)
* **Compliance Verification** (Evidence)

You do not "use" this repo. You **hire** it.

---

## Quick Start: Session Zero

You don't need to manually configure anything. The **Scrum Master** handles initialization.

### 1. Initialize the Agent

Open this folder in your AI IDE (Antigravity or Claude Code) and say:

> "Initialize the project."

### 2. Session Zero Interview

The Scrum Master will wake up, detect the empty project, and immediately interview you:

* "What are we building?"
* "What are the goals?"
* "Which AI model should we use?"

### 3. Autonomy Engaged

The team immediately begins work right here in this folder. No copying files, no switching directories.

---

## Workspace Structure

Your project lives here, co-located with the AI team that builds it.

## The Team (14 Agent Souls)

Every soul file in `.agent/souls/` defines a specialized agent with distinct responsibilities, tools, verification checks, and behavioral constraints.

| Domain | Agent | Focus |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Product** | Requirements BA | Stakeholder interviews, requirements elicitation |
| | User Story BA | Gherkin/AC user stories, acceptance criteria |
| **Engineering** | Architecture SE | System design, technology selection, diagrams |
| | Documentation SE | Living documentation, technical specs |
| **Development** | Backend Dev | APIs, server-side logic, integrations |
| | Frontend Dev | UI implementation, accessibility, client-side logic |
| | Database Engineer | Schema design, query optimization, data integrity |
| **Design** | UI/UX Designer | Wireframes, user flows, design systems |
| **Quality** | QA Engineer | Manual & exploratory testing, bug reporting |
| | Automation Engineer | CI test suites, E2E frameworks |
| **DevOps** | Pipeline DevOps | CI/CD construction, build automation |
| | Performance DevOps | Observability, load testing, optimization |
| **Management** | Scrum Master | Orchestration, velocity tracking, Session Zero |
| **Governance** | Program Analyst | CPMAI/ISO compliance, phase gate enforcement |

## How It Works

### Self-Annealing Protocol

Every agent follows a 4-step loop for every task:

1. **Validate** — Pre-flight checks (Do I have what I need?)
2. **Execute** — Perform the work
3. **Verify** — Self-review against requirements
4. **Correct** — Fix errors *before* handoff

### Double-Lock Governance

Two hard stops prevent agents from skipping steps:

* **Lock 1 (Scrum Master)**: No task starts without "Definition of Ready".
* **Lock 2 (Program Analyst)**: No phase advances without a passed Phase Gate.

---

## ROI Tracking

The system tracks the "Value Delta" between human and AI effort:

* **Human Estimate**: The Scrum Master estimates tasks at "Senior Developer" pace.
* **Agent Actual**: Agents log their real execution time.
* **Velocity Multiplier**: `Human Estimate / Agent Actual` — reported every sprint.
